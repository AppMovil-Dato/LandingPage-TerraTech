# LandingPage-TerraTech

## Description

Landing page for TerraTech, an agricultural solution for managing plots and sensors and viewing soil information. It presents the product's benefits, Pro and Enterprise plans, the NovaTech team, and a demo request form with a simulated loading state. No form data is sent. A soil features section presents moisture, nutrients, and temperature sensors. The terms and conditions modal is provisional: its nine sections contain generic draft terms based on the current informational version.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** semantic content structure.
- **CSS3:** responsive layout and interface styling.
- **JavaScript:** navigation, translations, app screen viewer, and form validation.
- **Inter and SVG:** typography and icons for the visual identity.

## Internationalization

The landing page is available in **Spanish and English** through the **ES / EN** selector. Spanish is the default language, and the user's preference is saved in `localStorage`.

Translations are stored in `public/i18n/es.json` and `public/i18n/en.json`. The native JavaScript engine in `public/js/i18n.js` loads them with `fetch`, applies translations, and manages the language preference without external libraries. Translations cover content, navigation, form labels, messages, accessible text, and metadata. Original app screenshots remain in Spanish.

Serve the project over HTTP using Live Server or `python -m http.server 4173 --bind 127.0.0.1`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. Opening `index.html` directly does not support JSON loading. If loading fails, the original Spanish content remains visible and translation-dependent controls stay disabled.
